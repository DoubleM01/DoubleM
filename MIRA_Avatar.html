        About the Project
        
            The MIRA Virtual Avatar project is a comprehensive system for generating realistic text-to-speech (TTS), emotion-based avatars, and synchronized video outputs. It integrates multiple services to create a seamless pipeline for generating expressive avatars with synchronized audio and video.

        Key Features
        The project offers the following key features:
        
            Text-to-Speech (TTS): Generate realistic speech from text using advanced TTS models.
            Emotion-Based Avatars: Create avatars that reflect specific emotions based on input parameters.
            Video Generation: Produce synchronized video outputs with audio and avatar animations.
            Customizable Pipelines: Modular design for integrating additional features or models.
        
    

    
        Technical Approach
        The project is structured into the following components:
        
            TTS Service: Utilizes advanced text-to-speech models to convert text input into realistic audio.
            SadTalker Integration: Leverages SadTalker for emotion-based avatar generation, allowing avatars to express specific emotions.
            Synchronization Pipeline: Combines audio and avatar animations to produce synchronized video outputs.
        
    

    
        Usage
