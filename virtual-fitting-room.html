    <!-- Project Objective -->
    <section class="project-section">
        <h2>Objective</h2>
        <p>
            To create an advanced Virtual Fitting Room (VFR) that allows customers to visualize how clothing fits on their bodies 
            by generating a 3D model based on video inputs. This aims to enhance the online shopping experience and address 
            common issues like inaccurate fit, high return rates, and the inability to physically try on clothing.

    <!-- Key Features and Components -->
    <section class="project-section">
        <h2>Key Features and Components</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Pose Estimation & Body Measurements:</strong> 
                Use of tools like OpenPose and SMPL for detecting body keypoints and generating a 3D human model. Extract accurate 
                body dimensions such as chest, waist, and inseam from videos.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>3D Reconstruction:</strong> Utilize SMPL models for realistic human shape and pose creation. Integrate 
                EasyMocap for aligning pose estimation data with the SMPL model.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Clothing Simulation:</strong> Simulate fabric behavior (elasticity, flow, fit) using physics-based algorithms.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Embedded Systems:</strong> ESP32 microcontroller is used to connect hardware (camera, sensors) to a mobile app.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Mobile Application:</strong> Developed in Android Studio, offering an intuitive interface for users to 
                upload videos, view results, and store their profiles securely.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Socket Server and Database:</strong> A server (powered by NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano) handles the processing 
                and connects with a lightweight SQLite database for user authentication.
            </li>
        </ul>

    <!-- Advantages -->
    <section class="project-section">
        <h2>Advantages</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Convenience & Safety: Allows customers to virtually try on clothes without removing their physical garments.</li>
            <li>Increased Conversion Rates: Enhances customer confidence in purchasing decisions, reducing return rates.</li>
            <li>Pandemic-Proof Shopping: Addresses hygiene and distancing concerns from fitting rooms.</li>
            <li>Cost Savings for Retailers: Eliminates the need for physical fitting rooms and staff overheads.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- Future Goals -->
    <section class="project-section">
        <h2>Future Goals</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Augmented Reality Integration: Enable users to visualize clothes on themselves in real-time via smartphone cameras.</li>
            <li>Enhanced Simulation: Incorporate dynamic animations and fabric-specific physics.</li>
            <li>AI-Powered Recommendations: Provide style and size recommendations based on user preferences.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- Workflow Chart -->
    <section class="project-section">
        <h2>System Workflow</h2>
        <p>The virtual fitting room operates with the following workflow:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>User Interaction: Upload a video or scan themselves using a mobile app.</li>
            <li>Data Processing: Pose estimation detects body landmarks, and body measurements are extracted for 3D modeling.</li>
            <li>Clothing Simulation: The chosen clothing is overlaid onto the 3D model, simulating fit and fabric behavior.</li>
            <li>Preview and Feedback: Users view a 360-degree model and receive recommendations for adjustments or alternative fits.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Workflow Chart:</strong> Input Video → Pose Estimation → 3D Reconstruction → Clothing Overlay → User Preview</p>
